# Jack is 25 years old. Jack wears a sze 9.5 shoe
# We got: TypeError: can only concatenate str (not int) to str
 # concatenate means to join together
 # it is saying we cannot join Strings and Integers together
 
 # Lets choose the naming conventrion for variables as all_lower_case with underscore for spaces
